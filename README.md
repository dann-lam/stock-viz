## Description

This stock visualizer gives you basic controls to view a ticker or company and it's associated price action on a chart.

Two interesting features that makes it stand apart from other stock projects is the ability to visualize news stories associated with said ticker and company, seeing when that story was published, and corresponding it on the Chart.

The second interesting feature is the ability to see which Congressperson is trading on said stock.

Install NPM, along with the associated packages, cd to client, and npm run start.

I do not provide API keys, there are three you will have to create, API links will be linked below.

## Learning Points

This was primarily a way for me to learn how to use ChartJS, and to get some good practice using React with semi-complex state management. The project itself was an enjoyable challenge, with many new features learned and re-learned.
