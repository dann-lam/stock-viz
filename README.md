OHhh lawwwwdy
Welcome to my super temporary readyme for this webapp.

What's the point? It's a data vizualization exercise.

User stories:

As a user, I want to be able to search for companies I'm interested in.

I then want to be able to see the results for said company and view the price per stock over time, whether it's a 1 year graph, 6 month graph, 1 month, or week.

I also want to compare that company's data with another company's data, I can have up to 3 comparisons per graph.

I want to be be able to see simple indicators as well, SMA, MACD, EMA, etc.

For each company, I want to be able to see general economic data on their overhead, revenue, costs, etc.

As a user, I want to be able to make an account so that I can save my searches.
